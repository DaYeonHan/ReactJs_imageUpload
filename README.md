# ReactJs_imageUpload
Created image uploading page with ReactJS

![Preview](https://github.com/DaYeonHan/ReactJs_imageUpload/blob/master/src/image/demo.gif "demo.gif")


Next things to do
------
1) ~~change Modal to ReactJS Modal~~

2) display uploaded image via url or ~~file upload under Add button~~

3) add remove on uploaded file

4) 

Bonus) change from CSS to Sass

What I learned
------
Class can have state & method
```javascript state = { }```
use ```javascript function``` than ```javascript class``` when it renders UI as it makes it less buggy
